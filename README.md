# 👋 Hi

My name is Daniel and I am a software and DevOps engineer. Love working with AWS and Go. 

## ☁️ Cloud

I work with AWS and Azure from work experience but prefer AWS. I'm learning K8s at the moment for work.

## ∞ DevOps

I found a love for DevOps culture and practices. Feels like the way we should be doing things. 

Enjoy automating away error prone tasks and helping solve workflow issues.

Favourite books on the topic are: The Phoenix Project, The Unicorn Project, The Goal, The DevOps Handbook and the SRE book from Google (sre.google/books).

## ⌨️ Languages

Learning Go currently, but have worked with Java, C#, Python and JavaScript.
